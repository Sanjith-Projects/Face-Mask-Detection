# Face-Mask-Detection

The objective of this project is to build a face mask detection system using computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms. By leveraging image processing and machine learning, we aim to accurately identify individuals wearing face masks and those not complying with mask-wearing guidelines. This system can be used to ensure compliance with public health measures and create safer environments in various settings.
